  abstract  = {We present custom JWST data reduction pipelines for JWST NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS observations of solar system objects. The pipelines simplify the process of reducing the JWST observations, and include custom steps to significantly improve the data quality. Our custom processing routines include a “desaturation” routine to reduce the effect of saturation while still maintaining high signal-to-noise ratio, and custom flat field correction code to remove the significant artifacts found in MIRI/MRS observations. The pipelines also automatically generate a series of quick look plots and animations to simplify exploration of a dataset. These custom JWST pipelines can be downloaded from https://github.com/JWSTGiantPlanets/pipelines.}
