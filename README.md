# JWST reduction pipelines
The reduction and visualisation code in this repository is used to call and extend the [standard JWST reduction pipeline](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst/) to process, reduce and analyse data for solar system observations.


## Setup
To run the pipelines yourself, first create a local clone of this repository with:
```
git clone https://github.com/JWSTGiantPlanets/pipelines.git
```

Then the required Python modules can then be installed with:

```
cd pipelines
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that these pipelines require Python 3.10 or above. 


## MIRI pipeline

TODO

## NIRSPEC pipeline
_The NIRSPEC pipeline is currently in development and will be released soon._
